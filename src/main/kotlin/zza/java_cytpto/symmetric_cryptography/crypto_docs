Modern cryptography solves three problems:

1. Confidentiality -> Using encryption/decryption
2. Data Integrity -> Using Cryptographic Hashing Algorithms.
3. Authenticity -> Using the TrustManagers and KeyManagers( In case of Secure HTTP connection, up to my knowlege as of know)

Hashing ----------- Produced the SHA-256 HASH digest of the message

Symmetric Encryption

Using the KeyGenerator
