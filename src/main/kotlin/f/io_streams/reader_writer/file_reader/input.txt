I think I am majorly missing on some topics which can't be skipped like coroutines, flows, testing, dependency injection,

making use of all these things and learning from the code written by Joris is a boon for me, he is an awesome architect.

I think I am majorly missing on some topics which can't be skipped like coroutines, flows, testing, dependency injection,

making use of all these things and learning from the code written by Joris is a boon for me, he is an awesome architect.

I think I am majorly missing on some topics which can't be skipped like coroutines, flows, testing, dependency injection,

making use of all these things and learning from the code written by Joris is a boon for me, he is an awesome architect.
